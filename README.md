Developer's Delight
===================

A web developer / designer's life can be difficult.  At times, it's hard to find the right tool for a project; at others, it's hard to find some inspiration.  Whatever problems you may face.  Whatever project you plan on tackling, I hope you find all that you need here.

“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.”
-Theodore Roosevelt
